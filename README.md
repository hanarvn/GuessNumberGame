# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java console-based number guessing game.

Unlike traditional guessing games that use Java's `Random` class to generate a number, this project uses a custom method to calculate the target number based on the user's input and some internal logic.

## Features

- Custom number generation logic
- User input handling
- Looping and conditional logic
- Basic input validation

## Purpose

This was one of my first Java projects, created during the early stages of learning the language. The goal was to practice working with methods, logic implementation, and user interaction via the console.

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using a Java compiler (e.g. `javac Main.java`)
2. Run the program: java Main
